Column,Description,Protocol/Context,Populated When,Empty/'-' When,Captures,Behavioral Relevance,TON-IoT Equiv
ts,Timestamp of the first packet of the connection (Unix epoch float),All protocols,Always — every Zeek connection gets a start timestamp,Never (Zeek always records ts),Context,MEDIUM — useful for temporal splits and time-of-day features,ts
uid,"Zeek unique connection ID (random base62 string — e.g., CqO5kl1SJ3fdmkM94)",All protocols,Always — Zeek assigns a UID to every connection,Never,Identity,NONE — just an internal key; not a behavioral feature,N/A
id.orig_h,Source IP address (originator host),All IP-based protocols,Always,Never,Identity,LOW for generalization — network-specific; causes topology overfitting,src_ip
id.orig_p,Source port number (originator),"TCP, UDP",TCP/UDP connections,0 for ICMP or portless protocols,Context,MEDIUM — ephemeral port patterns; low ports as source = suspicious,src_port
id.resp_h,Destination IP address (responder host),All IP-based protocols,Always,Never,Identity,LOW — same topology-overfitting risk as id.orig_h,dst_ip
id.resp_p,Destination port number (service being targeted),"TCP, UDP",TCP/UDP connections,0 for ICMP,Context,"HIGH — service identifier: 80=HTTP, 443=HTTPS, 22=SSH, 53=DNS, 8883=MQTT",dst_port
proto,"Transport layer protocol (tcp, udp, icmp, icmp6)",Meta — identifies the protocol,Always,Never,Context,HIGH — different protocols = different attack vectors,proto
service,"Application-layer service detected (http, dns, ssl, smtp, ssh, etc.)",Application layer (L7),Zeek successfully identifies the application protocol,"'-' when service is unknown, encrypted without SNI, or not recognized",Context,HIGH — '-' itself is informative (encrypted/evasive traffic),service
duration,Total duration of the network connection in seconds,All protocols,Connection has defined start and end (Zeek saw both SYN and FIN/RST or timeout),"'-' for single packets, ICMP, or flows terminated by capture end",Behavior,"VERY HIGH — short = scan/probe; long = data transfer, C2 keep-alive",duration
orig_bytes,Payload bytes sent from originator (client) to responder (server),All protocols,Originator transmitted payload data,"'-' for SYN-only probes, blocks, or RST without payload",Behavior,VERY HIGH — exfiltration detection; 0/'-' = scan; large = data transfer,src_bytes
resp_bytes,Payload bytes sent from responder (server) to originator (client),All protocols,Responder sent back payload data,'-' for unanswered or rejected connections,Behavior,VERY HIGH — asymmetry ratio orig_bytes/resp_bytes reveals attack type,dst_bytes
conn_state,Zeek TCP connection state code indicating handshake/teardown outcome,TCP primarily; abbreviated codes for UDP/ICMP,Always — Zeek assigns a state to every connection,Never (Zeek always records conn_state),Behavior,"VERY HIGH — state codes (S0, REJ, RSTOS0, OTH) are attack signatures",conn_state
local_orig,Boolean — whether the originator is local to the monitored network,All,Zeek could determine locality from configured local subnets,'-' when locality is indeterminate,Context,MEDIUM — inbound vs. outbound distinction; IoT devices always local,local_orig
local_resp,Boolean — whether the responder is local to the monitored network,All,Zeek could determine responder locality,'-' when indeterminate,Context,MEDIUM — lateral movement detection (local→local vs. exfil local→external),local_resp
missed_bytes,Bytes Zeek missed due to packet loss or capture limitation,Any,Always (0 when no packets missed),Never (defaults to 0),Metadata,LOW behavioral — HIGH data quality signal; non-zero = unreliable row,missed_bytes
history,"TCP flag history string (sequence of events: S=SYN, A=ACK, D=data, F=FIN, R=RST, …)",TCP,TCP connections with activity,"'-' for UDP, ICMP, or no TCP activity logged",Behavior,"VERY HIGH — encodes entire handshake pattern; e.g., 'S' alone = SYN scan",history
orig_pkts,Number of packets sent by originator,All protocols,Always (at least 1 for any logged connection),Should not be 0 or '-',Behavior,HIGH — packet flood detection; many pkts + 0 bytes = SYN scan,src_pkts
orig_ip_bytes,Total IP-layer bytes from originator (payload + headers),All IP protocols,Always when originator sent packets,Rarely '-',Behavior,HIGH — includes overhead; useful for header-overhead fingerprinting,N/A (not in TON-IoT)
resp_pkts,Number of packets sent by responder,All protocols,Responder replied with packets,0 for unanswered flows; '-' for some protocols,Behavior,HIGH — resp_pkts=0 = port close or firewall block,dst_pkts
resp_ip_bytes,Total IP-layer bytes from responder (payload + headers),All IP protocols,Always when responder sent packets,0 or '-' if no response,Behavior,HIGH — resp_ip_bytes / orig_ip_bytes ratio detects amplification attacks,N/A (not in TON-IoT)
tunnel_parents   label   detailed-label,Pattern-inferred: tunnel_parents   label   detailed-label — verify manually,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Label,N/A — target column,Unknown
source_scenario,Added by the loader — CTU-* folder name from which the row was loaded,N/A — provenance column,Always (added by load_conn_log),Never,Metadata,NONE for model — useful for stratification and scenario-aware splits,N/A
