Column,Description,Protocol/Context,Populated When,Empty/Dash When,Captures,Behavioral Relevance
ts,Timestamp of the first packet of the connection,All protocols,Always - every connection has a start time,Never,Context,Temporal patterns can reveal scheduled attacks or time-based anomalies
src_ip,Source IP address of the connection initiator,All IP-based protocols,Always,Never,Identity,LOW for generalization - network-specific identifier
src_port,Source port number (often ephemeral/random),"TCP, UDP (not ICMP)",TCP/UDP connections,ICMP or other portless protocols,Identity/Context,"MEDIUM - Ephemeral ports vary, but patterns may emerge"
dst_ip,Destination IP address (target of the connection),All IP-based protocols,Always,Never,Identity,LOW for generalization - network-specific identifier
dst_port,Destination port number (identifies target service),"TCP, UDP",TCP/UDP connections,ICMP or other portless protocols,Context,"HIGH - Service identification (80=HTTP, 22=SSH, etc.)"
proto,"Transport layer protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)",Meta-feature identifying the protocol,Always,Never,Context,HIGH - Different protocols have different attack vectors
service,"Application layer protocol/service detected (http, dns, ssh, etc.)",Application layer,Service could be identified from traffic,"""-"" when service unknown or encrypted",Context,HIGH - Service-specific attacks target specific services
duration,Total duration of the connection in seconds,All protocols,Connection has defined start and end,Single packet or timeout,Behavior,"HIGH - Short bursts may indicate scans, long connections may indicate C2"
src_bytes,Total bytes sent from source to destination,All protocols,Data was transmitted,Zero if no payload sent,Behavior,"HIGH - Data exfiltration detection, traffic volume anomalies"
dst_bytes,Total bytes sent from destination to source,All protocols,Response data was transmitted,Zero if no response or unidirectional,Behavior,"HIGH - Response patterns, download behavior"
conn_state,"Zeek connection state code (S0, S1, SF, REJ, RSTO, etc.)",TCP primarily,TCP connections with state tracking,UDP or stateless protocols,Behavior,VERY HIGH - Connection states reveal attack signatures
missed_bytes,Bytes missed due to packet loss or capture limitations,TCP,Packet loss detected,No packet loss,Metadata,LOW - Capture quality indicator
src_pkts,Number of packets from source to destination,All protocols,Always (at least 1),Never,Behavior,"HIGH - Packet flooding, DoS detection"
src_ip_bytes,Byte count related to src_ip_bytes,All protocols,Unknown,Unknown,Behavior,HIGH - Volume metric
dst_pkts,Number of packets from destination to source,All protocols,Response packets received,Zero if no response,Behavior,"HIGH - Response behavior, unidirectional attacks"
